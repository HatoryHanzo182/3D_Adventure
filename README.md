The project is a simple 3D game that uses ray tracing to display a 3D scene on the screen. The game allows the player to move around the map, turn around and explore the environment.

## Management

The player can control the character using the following keys:

- Left - turn left.
- Right - turn right.
- Forward - moving forward.
- Back - move backwards.

## Description

In this game you are inside a 3D labyrinth and your task is to explore it and find a way out. You control a character who can move around the maze, turn left or right, and move forward or backward. Using ray tracing, the game creates the impression of a 3D scene based on the distance to the walls and floor around you.

A 3D scene is displayed on the screen, where the walls are symbolized, the floor has its own symbol, and the character has a separate symbol on the minimap. The upper part of the screen is reserved for displaying information about the current position of the player and the number of frames per second.

The game map is read from the text file "MAP.txt". You can change the contents of this file to change the maze and game environment.
